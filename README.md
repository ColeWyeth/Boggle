# Boggle
This is a Python file I created for an Art of Problem Solving class. It simulates the game "Boggle." 
The program generates a grid (simulating die) andthen requests answers. It then checks if the answers are in the grid and awards points if
they are. It will not work if there isn't a dictionary for it to access in the same directory, but I have provided a dictionary.
